<!--
First, create a separate JS object literal (no constructor functions... yet) for each shop location that does the following:
-Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties
-Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random
-Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated
-Store the results for each location in a separate array... perhaps as a property of the object representing that location
-Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser
-Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:

1st and Pike

6am: 16 cookies
7am: 20 cookies
8am: 35 cookies
9am: 48 cookies
...etc...
Total: 657 cookies

-Display the lists on sales.html. We will be adding features to this application and working with its layout throughout the week.
-Here are the starting numbers that you'll need to build these objects:
Location	      Min Max Avg Cookie / Sale
1st and Pike	   23	65	6.3
SeaTac Airport	 3	24	1.2
Seattle Center	 11	38	3.7
Capitol Hill	   20	38	2.3
Alki	           2	16	4.6 -->
